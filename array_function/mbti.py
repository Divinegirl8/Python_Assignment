INFP
         Healer
         The Thoughtful Idealist (MBTI)
         The Mediator (16Personalisties)


The INFP Personality Type
        INFPs are imaginative idealists, guided by their own core values and beliefs.
           To a Healer , possibilities are paramount; the realism of the moment is only
           of passing concern. They see potential for a better future, and pursue truth
           and meaning with their own individual flair.
        INFPs are sensitive, caring, and compassionate, and are deeply concerned with
            the personal growth of themselves and others. Individualistic and
            non judgemental, INFPs believe that each person must find their own path. They
            enjoy spending time exploring their own ideas and values, and are gently
            encouraging to others to do the same. INFPs are creative and often artistic;
            they enjoy finding new outlets for self-expression.

        What does INFP stand for?
            INFP is one of the sixteen personality types created by Katherine Briggs and
            Isabel Myers, creators of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). INFP
            stands for Introversion, Intuition, Feeling, and Perceiving, which are four
            core personality traits based on the work of pyschologist C.G. Jung.
            Each of the four letters of the INFPs code signifies a key personality trait of
            this type. INFPs are energized by time alone (Introverted), focus on ideas
            and concepts rather than facts and details (iNtuitive), make decisions based
            on feelings and values (Feeling), and prefer to be spontaneous and flexible
            rather than planned and organized (Perceiving).

      The INFJ Personality Type
            Advocates (INFJs) may be the rarest personality type of all, but they certainly
            leave their mark on the world. Idealistic and principled, they aren’t content to
            coast through life – they want to stand up and make a difference. For Advocate personalities,
            success does not come from money or status but from seeking fulfillment, helping others,
            and being a force for good in the world.
                        
            While they have lofty goals and ambitions, Advocates shouldn’t be mistaken for idle dreamers.
            People with this personality type care about integrity, and they’re rarely satisfied until
            they’ve done what they know to be right. Conscientious to the core, they move through life with a clear
            sense of their values, and they aim never to lose sight of what truly matters – not according to other people
            or society at large, but according to their own wisdom and intuition.
                        
    Who is An Advocate (INFJ)?
            An Advocate (INFJ) is someone with the Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Judging personality traits.
            They tend to approach life with deep thoughtfulness and imagination. Their inner vision, personal values,
            and a quiet, principled version of humanism guide them in all things.

                – and one of the most capable – Architects (INTJs) know this all too well.
                Rational and quick-witted, Architects pride themselves on their ability to think for themselves,
                not to mention their uncanny knack for seeing right through phoniness and hypocrisy.
                But because their minds are never at rest, Architects may struggle to find people who can keep up with their

                Architects question everything. Many personality types trust the status quo, relying on conventional wisdom and
                other people’s expertise to guide their lives. But ever-skeptical Architects prefer to make their own discoveries.
                In their quest to find better ways of doing things, they aren’t afraid to break the rules or risk disapproval
                – in fact, they rather enjoy it.

        The ENTJ Personality Type
            Commanders are natural-born leaders. People with this personality type embody the gifts of charisma and confidence,
            and project authority in a way that draws crowds together behind a common goal. However, Commanders are also characterized
            by an often ruthless level of rationality, using their drive, determination and sharp minds to achieve whatever end they’ve set for themselves.
            Perhaps it is best that they make up only three percent of the population, lest they overwhelm the more timid and sensitive personality types
            that make up much of the rest of the world – but we have Commanders to thank for many of the businesses and institutions we take for granted every day.
                         
            If there’s anything Commanders love, it’s a good challenge, big or small, and they firmly believe that given enough time and resources,
            they can achieve any goal. This quality makes people with the Commander personality type brilliant entrepreneurs,
            and their ability to think strategically and hold a long-term focus while executing each step of their plans with determination and precision
            makes them powerful business leaders. This determination is often a self-fulfilling prophecy, as Commanders push their goals through with sheer
            willpower where others might give up and move on, and their Extraverted (E) nature means they are likely to push everyone else right along with them,
            achieving spectacular results in the process.

            Quick-witted and audacious, Debaters aren’t afraid to disagree with the status quo. In fact,
            they’re not afraid to disagree with pretty much anything or anyone. Few things light up people with this personality type

            Debaters are known for their rebellious streak. For this personality type, no belief is too sacred to be questioned,
            no idea is too fundamental to be scrutinized, and no rule is too important to be broken, or at least thoroughly tested.
            Sometimes Debaters even rebel against their own beliefs by arguing the opposing viewpoint – just to see how the world looks from the other side.

            opening their homes – and their hearts – to friends, loved ones, and neighbors. This doesn’t mean that Consuls like everyone,
            or that they’re saints. But Consuls do believe in the power of hospitality and good manners, and they tend to feel a sense of duty
            to those around them. Generous and reliable, people with this personality type often take it upon themselves – in ways both large and small – 
            to hold their families and their communities together. "
                        
            Consuls are altruists. They take seriously their responsibilities to give back, serve others, and do the right thing.
            And Consuls believe that there is a clear right thing to do in nearly every situation. While some personality types adopt a more lenient,
            live-and-let-live attitude, Consuls may find it difficult not to judge when someone takes a path that strikes them as misguided. As a result,
            Consuls often struggle to accept it when someone – particularly someone they care about – disagrees with them.

        The ISTP Personality Type
            Virtuosos love to explore with their hands and their eyes, touching and examining the world around them with cool rationalism and spirited curiosity.
            People with this personality type are natural Makers, moving from project to project, building the useful and the superfluous for the fun of it,
            and learning from their environment as they go. Often mechanics and engineers, Virtuosos find no greater joy than in getting their hands dirty
            pulling things apart and putting them back together, just a little bit better than they were before.
                                        
            Virtuosos explore ideas through creating, troubleshooting, trial and error and first-hand experience. They enjoy having other people take an
            interest in their projects and sometimes don’t even mind them getting into their space. Of course, that’s on the condition that those people don’t
            interfere with Virtuosos’ principles and freedom, and they’ll need to be open to Virtuosos returning the interest in kind. Virtuosos enjoy lending
            a hand and sharing their experience, especially with the people they care about, and it’s a shame they’re so uncommon, making up only about five
            percent of the population. Virtuoso women are especially rare, and the typical gender roles that society tends to expect can be a poor fit
            - they’ll often be seen as tomboys from a young age.
                        
            Who is A Virtuoso (ISTP)?
                        
                A Virtuoso (ISTP) is someone with the Introverted, Observant, Thinking, and Prospecting personality traits.
                They tend to have an individualistic mindset, pursuing goals without needing much external connection. They engage in life with inquisitiveness
                and personal skill, varying their approach as needed.

        The ISFP Personality Type
                Adventurers are true artists – although not necessarily in the conventional sense. For this personality type, life itself is a canvas
                for self-expression. From what they wear to how they spend their free time, Adventurers act in ways that vividly reflect who they are as unique individuals.
                And every Adventurer is certainly unique. Driven by curiosity and eager to try new things, people with this personality often have a fascinating
                array of passions and interests. With their exploratory spirits and their ability to find joy in everyday life, Adventurers can be among the
                most interesting people you’ll ever meet. The only irony? Unassuming and humble, Adventurers tend to see themselves as “just doing their own thing,”
                so they may not even realize how remarkable they really are.
                        
                Adventurers embrace a flexible, adaptable approach to life. Some personality types thrive on strict schedules and routines – but not Adventurers.
                Adventurers take each day as it comes, doing what feels right to them in the moment. And they make sure to leave plenty of room in their lives for the
                unexpected – with the result that many of their most cherished memories are of spontaneous, spur-of-the-moment outings and adventures,
                whether by themselves or with their loved ones.

        The ESTP Personality Type
                Entrepreneurs always have an impact on their immediate surroundings – the best way to spot them at a party is to look
                for the whirling eddy of people flitting about them as they move from group to group. Laughing and entertaining with a blunt and earthy humor,
                Entrepreneur personalities love to be the center of attention. If an audience member is asked to come on stage, Entrepreneurs volunteer –
                or volunteer a shy friend.
                        
                Theory, abstract concepts and plodding discussions about global issues and their implications don’t keep Entrepreneurs interested for long.
                Entrepreneurs keep their conversation energetic, with a good dose of intelligence, but they like to talk about what is – or better yet,
                to just go out and do it. Entrepreneurs leap before they look, fixing their mistakes as they go, rather than sitting idle,
                preparing contingencies and escape clauses.
